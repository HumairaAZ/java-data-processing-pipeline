# Java Data Processing Pipeline

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a data processing pipeline using Java. It reads data from a source, processes it, and outputs the results. This project highlights my skills in data engineering, Java programming, and performance optimization.

## Setup Instructions

1. Navigate to the project directory on GitHub.
2. Build the project using GitHub Actions.
3. Run the application using GitHub's CodeSpaces or Actions.

## Usage

1. Place your input data in the `data/input` directory.
2. Run the application. The processed data will be saved in the `data/output` directory.

## CI Setup

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration. The CI pipeline is defined in the `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file.

## Expected Results

The input data is processed and transformed according to the defined rules, and the output is saved in the `data/output` directory.
